How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

	I can check little differences between two versions and find some typos.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

	I can track every little change I made, and remind myself writing more readable code.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    manually: spend more time, but more logical and readable 
    automatically: prevent forgetting to save the file, but not the best time to save

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git: file are related, and affect each other
    Google Docs: seperate

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log: check all the commits
    git diff: check the details of change

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can come back anytime, and it won't take me too much time to find a bug between little change.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Version Control
